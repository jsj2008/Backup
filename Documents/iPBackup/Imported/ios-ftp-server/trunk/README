DiddyFtpServer is a very simple Ftp server library written in Cocoa/Objective C that you can include into your 
projects to add file access.


I have only added a subset of Ftp Commands.

Currently the major issue is...

Windows Explorer : hangs when asked to transfer a file
Long file transfers sometimes hang.  

I'm still working on this, but someone else might spot a bug faster.

Known clients I have got this working with are   Transmit from Panic and FileZilla.

I'm releasing this as I want to concentrate on other parts of my app and hope that other people can get involved and 
make this into a really useful library for cocoa programmers.

My thanks to Dustin Voss for the AsyncSocket routines which I have used.
AsyncSocket can be found at http://code.google.com/p/cocoaasyncsocket/
and that part is covered by his own copyright that is included in the headers.


This library is covered by the terms of LGPL which is included.  share code, make life easier.
